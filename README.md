# AA 274 Course Materials
An aggregation of links to course materials for the AA 274 set of courses at Stanford, primarily taught by Prof. Marco Pavone.

## AA 274A: Principles of Robot Autonomy I

1. First and foremost, the [course website](http://asl.stanford.edu/aa274a/) is the best place to find any lectures, assignments, sections, etc. If materials are needed that are still to be taught chronologically during the quarter, [last year's course website](http://asl.stanford.edu/aa274_aut1920/) has all materials available for all weeks.

2. The raw lecture slide PowerPoint files can be obtained by reaching out to the instructor, Prof. Marco Pavone (`pavone@stanford.edu`).

3. The raw lecture note LaTeX files can be obtained by reaching out to the instructor, Prof. Marco Pavone (`pavone@stanford.edu`).

4. The assignments and their starter code are available at:
    1. HW1: [PDF](http://asl.stanford.edu/aa274a/pdfs/homework/hw1.pdf), [Code](https://github.com/PrinciplesofRobotAutonomy/AA274A_HW1)
    2. HW2: [PDF](http://asl.stanford.edu/aa274a/pdfs/homework/hw2.pdf), [Code](https://github.com/PrinciplesofRobotAutonomy/AA274A_HW2)
    3. HW3: [PDF](http://asl.stanford.edu/aa274a/pdfs/homework/hw3.pdf), [Code](https://github.com/PrinciplesofRobotAutonomy/AA274A_HW3) 
    4. HW4: [PDF](http://asl.stanford.edu/aa274a/pdfs/homework/hw4.pdf), [Code](https://github.com/PrinciplesofRobotAutonomy/AA274A_HW4)

The original LaTeX files for the PDFs can be obtained by request from Prof. Marco Pavone. We do _not_ plan to release solutions for these, it took many years to develop this set of assignments.

5. If students are expected to use their own computers for the course, then [this repo](https://github.com/PrinciplesofRobotAutonomy/aa274-docker) contains virtual machine installation instructions and useful scripts for working with ROS in a VM. 
    - It can be quite a task to install ROS, and we didn't want to subject students to that. Instead, we provide them virtual machines containing ROS (and other packages) for the 3 most common operating systems (Linux, macOS, Windows) used nowadays by students.
    - **A word of warning:** Gazebo and other similar robotic simulation software can be quite resource intensive. As a result, running simulations in Gazebo within a virtual machine on a laptop (quite a common use case with this course...) can be _painfully_ slow. 

6. All section handouts, slides, and code can be found in [this repository](https://github.com/PrinciplesofRobotAutonomy/AA274_SECTION).

7. The final project changes slightly every year, but [last year's project](http://asl.stanford.edu/aa274_aut1920/project.html) is a stable jump-off point.
    - The starter code for the ASL-provided turtlebots can be found at [this repo](https://github.com/StanfordASL/asl_turtlebot).
